                                <li>Stop into any our ice cream parlor or peak inside the case at the supermarket, and you will witness the expansive array of flavors, from traditional vanilla and coffee ice creams to somewhat unusual flavors such as sweet basil and sweet potato. But when it comes to gelato, the flavor profile is much more narrow. There are a few classics you'll find in gelato form—vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, and stracciatella (vanilla with crunchy chocolate pieces), as well as pistachio, tiramisu, and a variety of fruit flavors—but not necessarily the type of combinations you see in the ice cream aisle.</li>
                                <li>The differences in both treats' compositions and the way they are stored affect the way they taste and feel in your mouth. Fat coats the tongue, creating a layer between the taste buds and the food you are eating, and colder food numbs the tongue a bit, making it more difficult to actually taste the food. Since gelato has less fat and is warmer than ice cream, the flavors come through more and are more intense. These factors also make for a smoother consistency whereas ice cream has more of a fine crystal texture.</li>
